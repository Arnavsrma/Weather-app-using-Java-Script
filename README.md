# Weather app using HTML,CSS and Java Script
I have made a weather app using HTML,Css and Java Script. Here I will get the current weather data from API key from OpenWeatherMap and display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city on our website or app.I will display the weather info on website from Free API using JavaScript.In this there is one search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
